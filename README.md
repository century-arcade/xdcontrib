1. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
2. Rename all of the .puz so that their names are aligned with the .xd standard (`idYYYY-MM-DD.puz`)
3. run `sh convert.sh SRCPUZ OUTXD`
where
SRCPUZ is the relative location of the directory holding the .puz
OUTXD is the relative location of the directory which will hold the .xd
